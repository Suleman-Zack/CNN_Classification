# CNN_Classification
## Description
The MNIST data is a popular dataset in the image recognition. The dataset consist of handwritten digits with their associated labels. The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.It was created by "re-mixing" the samples from NIST's original datasets.[description_link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database)<br>

## Project objective
Basically this project is my personal introduction into Artificial Neural Networks. I take this opportunity to learn and kick start my career in AI. Hence the following are the objectives of this project.
* The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively.
* Practise the use of neural networks for classification
* Understand the concepts of convolutional neural networks
